You can specify what logs you want to collect by the switches that are available, then the script has logic built in to determine how to collect the data. How to Run The script must be run as Administrator in PowerShell session on an Exchange Server or Tools box. Supported to run and collected logs against Exchange 2013 and greater. The intent of the script is to collect logs only that you need from X servers quickly without needing to have to manually collect it yourself and label zip them all up for you. If you don't know what logs to collect, it is recommended to use -AllPossibleLogs . This script no longer supports collecting logs from Exchange 2010. However, the last release of v2 should still work just fine. You can download that here . The script is able to collect from the large set of servers while using the Invoke-Command. Prior to executing the main script, we check to make sure the server is up and that we are able to use Invoke-Command against the server. If Invoke-Command works remotely, then we will allow you to attempt to collect the data. You can still utilize the script to collect locally as it used to be able to, if the target OS doesn't allow this. Prior to collecting the data, we check to make sure that there is at least 10GB of free space at the location of where we are trying to save the data of the target server. The script will continue to keep track of all the logs and data that is being copied over and will stop if we have less than 10GB of free space. You are able to use a config file to load up all the parameters you wish to choose and the servers you wish to run the script against. Just create a file called ExchangeLogCollector.ps1.json and place at the same location as the script. Then provide the switches you would like to use in the file like so: { \"Servers\": [ \"ADT-E16A\", \"ADT-E16B\", \"ADT-E16C\" ], \"FilePath\": \"C:\\\\MS_Logs\", \"IISLogs\": true, \"AcceptEULA\": true, \"AppSysLogsToXml\": false, \"ScriptDebug\": true } NOTE: It is import that you use \\\\ for the file path otherwise the settings will fail to load.

There are many, many resources on how to use Git and GitHub. We recommend starting with Pro Git . Reading chapters 1 to 3 provides a great foundation for understanding and using Git. This page will serve as a quick start that leads you through submitting a Pull Request to CSS-Exchange step by step. This page will not cover the use of any GUI that attempts to insulate the user from the Git command line. In this author's opinion, the only way to really learn Git is to use the command line, so that's all we'll cover here. Before You Start If you are considering a large change to a script or a brand new script, it's often a good idea to open an Issue first to discuss the change. This will allow the repository owners to provide feedback on whether they would accept this type of change. By getting feedback before you spend days on a complex change, you can ensure that you're not wasting your time. Installation Install PowerShell 7 or later . Install Visual Studio Code . You'll need this to develop scripts for this project. Assuming you're running Windows, install Git For Windows . When it asks for your default editor, choose Visual Studio Code. The rest of the defaults are fine. If you're on a different operating system, refer to the Git documentation for instructions. Optional but recommended: Install Posh Git in your PowerShell 7+ shell. This adds some useful features such as branch name autocompletion in PowerShell. Forking the repository The first step is to fork the repository on GitHub. Unless you have Write access to CSS-Exchange, you can't push directly to our repo. Creating a fork creates your own copy of the repo on GitHub, so you have somewhere to push your changes. To fork the repository, use the Fork icon at the top right of the repository page. You'll be prompted for a name and description. The defaults are fine. When the fork is complete, you'll be taken to the new repository page. At the top left, you should see that you are now on your own fork. Cloning the repository Now you're ready to start using the git command line. To clone the repository, drop down the Code button and copy the URL: Then use that URL to clone the repository using the command line: git clone < url > This creates a folder called CSS-Exchange in your current directory. Creating a new branch Change into the folder that was just created. Your shell should now look something like this. Because we have PoshGit loaded, it's showing our current branch name in the prompt - main. Let's create a new branch for our work. It's nice to use a descriptive name. For example, if we're updating this guide, we might call name it like so: Making changes Now that you're on your own branch, you're ready to make your changes. You can technically use any tool you like - notepad, vim, whatever. But, if you open the repo root folder in Visual Studio Code, many of the repository formatting settings will be applied automatically. You can also shift-alt-F to reformat a file according to the settings. This may save you some time later. For this example, I created a new script called New-Script.ps1. After making our changes, it's a good idea to verify that git sees everything we changed, and that we haven't changed any files we didn't intend to. Because we have PoshGit, just hitting Enter to get a new prompt shows us some information about how many files have changed. We can also run git status to see some details. This looks good. My intent was to add one script file, and that's the only change shown here. Formatting changes CSS-Exchange has some formatting requirements to ensure consistency, and these checks are integrated into our build process. Before committing changes, let's run .build\\CodeFormatter.ps1 to see if our new script meets the requirements. CodeFormatter highlighted a few problems here: File has no newline at the end. File is missing the required compliance header. File has no BOM. We require a BOM on scripts. The formatting of the code itself is not using the correct brace style. This is shown in a warning, followed by diff output illustrating the required change. In addition, a PSScriptAnalyzer check at the end highlights the same issue with the PSPlaceOpenBrace rule. CodeFormatter will fix some problems automatically if the -Save switch is included. Let's run it again with -Save. Here we see CodeFormatter automatically fixed all of these issues when run with the -Save switch. Running a second time, we can confirm everything was fixed, as it generates no output at all. Staging changes We're almost ready to commit our changes, but first we should stage them. Staging gives us a chance to sanity-check what we're about to commit before we actually commit. It's especially useful when we have modified several files for testing, but we only intend to commit some of them. If we run git status again, we should once again see that only one file is modified for our simple test case. Then we can stage our file with git add , and check the result again with git status . When we have many files to commit, we can use git add . to stage all files in the current folder and subfolders, or git add :/ to stage all files everywhere. When using those options, it's especially important to check git status to make sure we haven't staged something we didn't intend to. Committing changes If git status shows that the correct files are staged, we can commit them with git commit . This will open the default editor, which will be Visual Studio Code if you chose it when installing Git as described earlier. The top line should be the title of the commit. Then skip a line and add further details as necessary. Close the tab, choose Save when prompted, and we see the following output. Now our changes are committed to our local copy of our branch, but we need to push those to GitHub. Pushing the changes Because this is the first time we're pushing changes for our new branch, we have to provide a few details. On our first push of our new branch, the syntax will be git push -u origin <branch name> . Origin means we're pushing to the location we cloned from - this is the name of the remote repo by default. The -u parameter tells it to set this as our upstream for this branch. We only have to do this the first time. If we make additional changes on this branch and commit them, we can now push them to the server with a simple git push , since we have now told it that origin will be our upstream going forward. Now we're ready to request that our changes be pulled into the official repo. Creating a Pull Request There are a few ways to create a Pull Request. We can see in the previous screenshot that GitHub helpfully shows us a URL we can visit to start a Pull Request. You can also manually navigate to the Pull Request tab of the official repo, and create a new Pull Request there. You might even see a prompt to create a PR for the branch you just pushed. Either of these methods will work. At this point we're presented with a form to provide some details about the PR. Be sure that at the top of the PR form, we see the offical repo and the main branch on the left, followed by your fork and the branch you created on the right. Fill in the details and hit Create Pull Request. Responding to feedback The repository owners will often request some changes to our code by commenting on the Pull Request. To update the code in the Pull Request, simply make the additional changes in your local files, stage them, and commit them just as before. Then, git push . Remember, we don't need any other parameters on the push this time. After pushing new changes, we should see the PR update almost instantly. Once the owners are satisfied with the changes, they will approve and merge the PR. And we're done! Cleaning up Once the PR is merged, we can delete our fork and delete the folder containing our local clone. We can keep the fork around if we intend to contribute further, but the main branch of the fork will not automatically pull in the latest changes from the official repo. It will get further and further out of date, which may cause problems with future pull requests. To avoid this, we'll need to pull in the changes from the main branch of the official repo into our fork.

Using Named Collectors It is possible to run several SimplePerf collectors on the same computer at the same time by providing the -CollectorName parameter. For example: .\\ SimplePerf -Start -Interval 60 -CollectorName \"Minute\" .\\ SimplePerf -Start -Interval 5 -CollectorName \"FiveSeconds\" When using collector names, the same name must be provided to the -Stop command: .\\ SimplePerf -Stop -CollectorName \"Minute\" .\\ SimplePerf -Stop -CollectorName \"FiveSeconds\" Counter Name Filters The counters collected by SimplePerf can be controlled with a combination of three parameters: -Scenario , -IncludeCounters , and -ExcludeCounters . Currently, there are only two scenarios: Exchange and None . The Exchange scenario is a common set of counters for Exchange Server, similar to what ExPerfWiz would collect. None is a completely empty counter set. -IncludeCounters and -ExcludeCounters perform a StartsWith match against the counter name. This makes it possible to collect a large number of counters with minimal syntax. For example: .\\ SimplePerf . ps1 -Start -IncludeCounters \"\\MSExchange\" , \"\\Microsoft Exchange\" This example starts a SimplePerf using the Exchange scenario, but then it includes every counter starting with either MSExchange or Microsoft Exchange. .\\ SimplePerf . ps1 -Start -IncludeCounters \"\\MSExchange\" , \"\\Microsoft Exchange\" -Scenario \"None\" This example starts a SimplePerf collecting all the matching Exchange counters without including any default counters at all, because the None scenario was specified. .\\ SimplePerf . ps1 -Start -ExcludeCounters \"\\MSExchange Transport\" In this example, we use the Exchange scenario as a starting point, but then we remove all counters starting with MSExchange Transport. Note that individual counters can be excluded even if the counter set has been included. To illustrate: In this screenshot we see all the counters that exist for the Thread set. If we tell SimplePerf to include \"\\Thread\", then it simply collects the whole object. However, if we tell it to Include \"\\Thread\" but exclude \"\\Thread(*)\\Priority\", we see that it has correctly expanded the Thread object and is collecting all counters except \"Priority Current\" and \"Priority Base\". This filtering mechanism makes it easy to customize the counter set with minimal text. To check the result of your counter filters, add the -Verbose switch, or check the counters txt file in $env:TEMP. Note that the resulting set can only show counters that exist on the local machine. For instance, you won't see any Exchange counters in the Verbose output if the script is not running on an Exchange Server. Language Support SimplePerf works regardless of the current language. It does this by translating the provided counter filters to whatever the current server language happens to be. This means that counter names must always be provided in English, even when the current language is not English.

Limit FolderPathDepth The folder path is greater than 299 folders deep. Limit HierarchyCount There are more than 250,000 total folders in the hierarchy. Limit HierarchyAndDumpsterCount There are more than 250,000 total folders if you count both the folders and their dumpsters. Limit ItemCount The folder has more than 1,000,000 items.

MailEnabledFolder MailEnabledWithNoADOjbect The folder is mail-enabled, but it has no Active Directory object. MailEnabledFolder OrphanedMPF An Active Directory object exists, but it is not linked to any folder. MailEnabledFolder OrphanedMPFDuplicate An Active Directory object exists, but it points to a public folder which points to a different object.

The final test, which checks permissions, will usually take much longer than the other tests. When all the tests are done, the script provides a summary of what it found, along with example commands that fix some issues. In this example output, the script calls out four issues. First, it points out that we have 111,124 folders that are completely empty (this is a lab). Note the ResultType of EmptyFolder. If we want to see the list of empty folders, we can open up ValidationResults.csv in Excel, filter for a ResultType of EmptyFolder, and then we see all those results: For these folders, no action is required. The script is just giving us information. The next thing it calls out is that 4 folders have problematic characters in the name. The output tells us these have a ResultType of SpecialCharacters. Filtering for that in the CSV, we see the folders. Fortunately, the script gives us a command we can run to fix all the names. We can copy and paste the command it gave us, let it run, and then spot check the result. Now that the names are fixed, we move on to the next item. The script tells us we have a mail public folder object for a public folder that is mail-disabled. For this type of problem, we need to examine the folder and figure out what we want to do. The CSV file gives us the DN of the mail object and the entry ID of the folder, which we can use to examine the two objects. The folder says MailEnabled is False, yet we have a MailPublicFolder which points to it. We need to decide whether we want the folder to receive email or not. For this lab, I decide I do want the folder to be mail-enabled, so I remove the orphaned MailPublicFolder and then mail-enable the folder. I also confirm the new object has the same email address as the old one. This might need to be adjusted manually in some cases, but here I didn't have to.

An administrator should review the files to determine if they are valid. Determining if a zip file is a valid part of an installed product is outside the scope of this script, and whitelisting files by name would only encourage the use of those specific names by attackers. I'm having trouble running the script on Exchange 2010. If PowerShell 3 is present, the script can be run on Exchange 2010. It will not run-on PowerShell 2. One can also enable PS Remoting and run the script remotely against Exchange 2010. However, the script has minimal functionality in these scenarios, as Exchange 2010 is only affected by one of the four announced exploits - CVE-2021-26857. Further, this exploit is only available if the Unified Messaging role is present. As a result, it is often easier to simply run the Get-EventLog command from the blog post , rather than using Test-ProxyLogon.","title":"Test-ProxyLogon"},{"location":"Security/Test-ProxyLogon/#test-proxylogonps1","text":"Download the latest release: Test-ProxyLogon.ps1 Formerly known as Test-Hafnium, this script automates all four of the commands found in the Hafnium blog post .
